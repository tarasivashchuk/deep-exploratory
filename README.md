# deep-topts
Collection of experiments and personal studies in **deep learning**. There are currently three packages that are included 
within the `src` directory, each with a unique foundational idea behind them.

Work on this is done when I have some spare time or have an idea I want to experiment with and test, so updates aren't 
regular, but if I decide to stop development I will make sure to update this README.

##### Usage Permission
If you use code from the `opt-experimental` package then it'd be awesome if you shoot me an email to let me know about it 
as I would love to hearand give me credit. I won't sue you or anything if you don't though - just relying on people 
hopefully being supportive and honest.

##### Contact Details
Feel free to contact me at [taras@tarasivashchuk.com](mailto:taras@tarasivashchuk.com) for anything related to this 
repository or software engineering in general and I'll respond, unless it's just spam, hate mail, or anything 
completely unrelated.


##### Prerequisites
- **Python** (3.7)
    - Pytorch was installed for this version of Python, and even though I haven't tested it, any 3.5+ version should 
    work fine
- **Numpy** (1.16.5)
- **Pytorch** (1.3.0)
    - Only needed for the `opt-experimental` package

#### List of Project Packages

##### 1. opt-experimental
This package is where I experiment with implementing various ideas I have about neural networks and any 
supporting algorithms or structures. This can include everything from unique architectures to optimization 
functions.

##### 2. opt-nn
Deep learning library built from the ground-up without any deep learning libraries or frameworks. Numpy is 
used to handle optimized matrix and tensor operations.

##### 3. opt-utils
Utility modules for dataset related functionality, data cleaning, and other things along those lines. 
Currently only has code for generating dummy datasets for testing purposes.
