# Personal Machine and Deep Learning Experiments
> This project is little more than a placeholder right now. Feel free to watch it for updates though!

Collection of experiments and personal studies in **deep learning**.

Work on this is done when I have some spare time or have an idea I want to experiment with and test, so updates aren't 
regular, but if I decide to stop development I will make sure to update this README.

##### Usage Permission
If you use code from the `opt-experimental` package then it'd be awesome if you shoot me an email to let me know about it 
as I would love to hear about it. But if anything here helps you, feel free to use it in the same way as if you had
wrote it.

##### Contact Details
Feel free to contact me at [taras@tarasivashchuk.com](mailto:taras@tarasivashchuk.com) for anything related to this 
repository or software engineering in general and I'll respond, unless it's just spam, hate mail, or stuff like that.


#### "Dude, I don't care, can I use your code or not?" Section
**If anything here is helpful to you, feel free to use it however you need. Giving me a shoutout is nice but not required.**
